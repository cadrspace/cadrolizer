* Рах CADROLIZER
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things][IoT]] gears for [[http://hackerspaces.org/][hackerspaces]].

** Why "cadrolizer"?
   The project's name is a reference to "localizers" from Vernor Vinge's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky]["A
   Deepness in the Sky"]] sci-fi novel.

** Requirements
   - [[https://www.iotivity.org/][IoTivity]] 0.9.0
   - Boost 1.55
   - scons

** Building and installation
   The project can be built using =scons= tool:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scons iotivity-path=/path/to/iotivity-distribution
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Installation can be done as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scons install
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Configuration
   The configuration is stored in =/etc/cadrolizer.conf=.

   Possible parameters are:

   - description :: Description of the host (e.g. "Desktop".)
   - services :: List of services provided by the host.  You can use =<host>=
                 variable instead of writting the actual hostname or the IP
                 address -- it's expected that a client should substitute the
                 hostname for this variable.
   - enable-shutdown :: Enable remote shutown/reboot of the machine.  Allowed
        values: "yes", "no"

** Usage
   The application consists of two parts: =cadrolizer= daemon which connects
   the machine to the IoT network of cadrolizers, and =cadr= tool to manage
   cadrolizers around.

   First of all, you should check if the configuration in
   =/etc/cadrolizer.conf= is OK for you.

   Then, start a =cadrolizer= daemon on each machine that should be connected
   to the cadrolizers network:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cadrolizer --cadrolize
#+END_EXAMPLE

   When a daemon is started, the information about machines may be queried
   with =cadr= tool:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cadr -l
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Note that if you're going to shutdown/reboot machines remotely by means of
   =cadr= tool, you must make sure that =cadrolizer= daemon has sufficient
   rights to call =shutdown(8)= command.

   Please use =-h= or =--help= flag to get the more detailed information on
   each tool.
