* CADROLIZER
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things][IoT]] gears for [[http://hackerspaces.org/][hackerspaces]].

** Requirements
   - [[https://www.iotivity.org/][IoTivity]] 0.9.0
   - Boost 1.55
   - scons

** Configuration
   The configuration is stored in =/etc/cadrolizer.conf=.

   Possible parameters are:

   - description :: Description of the host (e.g. "Desktop".)
   - services :: List of services provided by the host.  You can use =<host>=
                 variable instead of writting the actual hostname or the IP
                 address -- it's expected that a client should substitute the
                 hostname for this variable.
